# Acoustic Morse-Based Ultrasonic Signaling System 🚨📡

An innovative project that transmits data using ultrasonic sound waves based on Morse code principles. This system is designed for secure, contactless, and low-bandwidth communication between devices using only audio signals — inaudible to human ears.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This system uses **ultrasonic frequencies** (typically above 20 kHz) to encode and transmit **Morse code** signals acoustically. It can be used in environments where traditional wireless communications (e.g., Bluetooth, Wi-Fi) are not feasible or desirable.

## 🎯 Features

- 📡 **Ultrasonic transmission** (inaudible to humans)
- 🔠 Morse code encoding & decoding
- 🎙️ Microphone and speaker-based communication (no special hardware)
- 🔒 Contactless and low-power signaling
- 🔁 One-way or two-way transmission supported
- 🧪 Experimental real-world testing for signal integrity

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- A device with a working **microphone** and **speaker**
- Headphones recommended for testing (to avoid feedback)

### 📦 Installation

git clone https://github.com/Abhi95081/Acoustic_Morse-Based_Ultrasonic_Signaling_System.git
cd Acoustic_Morse-Based_Ultrasonic_Signaling_System
pip install -r requirements.txt

### 🧪 How It Works
- Text is converted to Morse code.
- Morse code is converted to audio tones (dots and dashes) in the ultrasonic range.
- The signal is emitted via a speaker.
- A microphone on the receiving end captures the sound.
- Signal is processed and decoded back into readable text.

 ### 📈 Use Cases
- Secure communication in restricted zones
- Low-power short-range data transfer
- Education and signal processing demos
- Emergency signaling in offline areas
